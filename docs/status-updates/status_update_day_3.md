Today was a big day; we finally integrated the API made by the back-end team we're working with and it managed to work very well with our structure. Given the API had a lot more pokémon, more than tenfold from PokeAPI's limited pokémon list, we decided to make a functioning search bar. Of course, using the built-in function of "search on page"(keybind: ctrl+f) will work, but not everyone knows of this function.
